Next-Generation Security Entity Linkage: Harnessing the Power of Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models.

***

I had the opportunity to present part of my thesis research: "Next-Generation Security Entity Linkage: Harnessing the Power of Knowledge Graphs and Large Language Models." at the <a href='https://www.systor.org/2023/'>SYSTOR 2023</a> ACM conference.

The poster presentation was a fantastic opportunity to share my findings and engage with experts in the field. I had the privilege of discussing the potential of knowledge graphs and large language models in enhancing cybersecurity. The positive feedback I received was truly inspiring.

You can find the poster and extended abstract on the DEEPNESS-lab website <a href='https://deepness-lab.org/publications/next-generation-security-entity-linkage-harnessing-the-power-of-knowledge-graphs-and-large-language-models/'>here</a>.
