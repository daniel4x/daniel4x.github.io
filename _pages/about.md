Hello, I'm Daniel Alfasi, a Data Scientist at CyberArk and a researcher at <a href='https://deepness-lab.org/'>DEEPNESS-Lab</a>. My interests revolve around solving real-world problems in cybersecurity using deep-learning methods. In addition, I'm interested in Knowledge graph reasoning, NLP methods, and generative AI.

Feel free to reach out to me if you want to discuss my research, have any questions, or are interested in collaborating.
